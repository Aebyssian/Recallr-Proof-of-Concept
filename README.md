# Recallr-Proof-of-Concept

This is a proof-of-concept app that is in development by Jake Wilson to demonstrate a basic spaced repetition memorization system. 
The goal is to have a program that uses the SuperMemo 2 algorithm to allow users to study a few of the simple card types from Anki in an SRS style.
