# Recallr-Proof-of-Concept

This is a proof-of-concept app that is in development by Jake Wilson to demonstrate a basic spaced repetition memorization system. he goal for this is to have a program that uses the SuperMemo 2 algorithm to allow users to study a few of the simple card types from Anki in an SRS style.
The overall goal is to eventually create an advanced spaced repetition program that uses the two-component model of memory (ie, something similar to SM-18) as well as machine learning to provide users the most efficient method to memorize information.
